<p>2019 was a transition year for me personally, and by extension, Stratechery. The nadir was an Article I regret — <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-wework-ipo/">The WeWork IPO</a> — where, despite not believing in the company, I wrote the contrarian take because it seemed more interesting (my full <em>mea culpa</em> is <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/softbank-rescues-wework-owning-wework-zuckerberg-in-congress/">here</a>). It was not a healthy approach, but, six years after starting Stratechery, and five years of it being my full-time job, it was perhaps an understandable one.</p>
<p>The turning point was <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-china-cultural-clash/">The China Cultural Clash</a>; writing about the crisis surrounding the NBA in China and the implications for the technology industry reminded me of something I had started to forget in my attempt to be even-handed and dispassionate in my analysis: values matter, and there is a freedom that comes from recognizing and articulating those values. Indeed, honesty about values makes analysis better, because underlying assumptions are pushed to the forefront, instead of fading to the background — and, I&#8217;d add, it is invigorating! On to 2020!</p>

<p>Here is the 2019 list.</p>
<h4>The Five Most-Viewed Articles</h4>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-wework-ipo/">The WeWork IPO</a> — This, to be perfectly frank, is brutal: I not only regret this article for being insufficiently negative (although, for the record, I was clear I would not invest in WeWork), but now also have to face the fact it was my most popular post of the year. <em>Related: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/uber-questions/">Uber Questions</a>, which took the boring skeptical approach to an S-1 I should have repeated.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-google-squeeze/">The Google Squeeze</a> — Google, the real Aggregator, is squeezing OTAs, which acted like Aggregators while depending on Google for demand. It’s easy to say Google is being unfair, but this may be better for consumers.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/">Shopify and the Power of Platforms</a> — It is all but impossible to beat an Aggregator head-on, as Walmart is trying to do with Amazon. The solution instead is to build a platform like Shopify.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/disney-and-the-future-of-tv/">Disney and the Future of TV</a> — TV is moving from a world where distribution dictates business models to one where business models need to fit the jobs consumers want done. That is the best way to understand Disney’s latest announcement.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/aws-mongodb-and-the-economic-realities-of-open-source/">AWS, MongoDB, and the Economic Realities of Open Source</a> — Amazon’s latest offering highlights the economic challenges facing open source companies — and Amazon should pay attention.</li>
</ol>
<div align="center"><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2.jpeg" alt="A drawing of The Shopify Ecosystem" width="650" height="492" class="size-full wp-image-4282" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2.jpeg 973w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2-300x227.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2-768x581.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2-833x630.jpeg 833w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></div>
<h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
<p>The good thing about making mistakes is that it is an opportunity to learn; two of these articles are directly connected to WeWork.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/neither-and-new-lessons-from-uber-and-vision-fund/">Neither, and New: Lessons from Uber and Vision Fund</a> — Uber represents something new: a company that is different than incumbents because of technology, yet not itself a tech company — just like the Vision Fund is not a VC.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/what-is-a-tech-company/">What is a Tech Company?</a> — The question of “What is a tech company” comes down to how much software and its unique characteristics affects the company’s core business.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-value-chain-constraint/">The Value Chain Constraint</a> — Companies succeed or fail not based on technology but rather according to their ability to integrate within their value chains.</li>
</ul>
<div align="center"><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-value-chain-constraint/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Paper.stratechery-Year-One-copy.392-1024x606.png" alt="A drawing of Amazon&#039;s Value Chain" width="640" height="379" class="size-large wp-image-4045" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Paper.stratechery-Year-One-copy.392-1024x606.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Paper.stratechery-Year-One-copy.392-300x177.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Paper.stratechery-Year-One-copy.392-768x454.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Paper.stratechery-Year-One-copy.392-1065x630.png 1065w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></div>
<h4>Values and Society</h4>
<p>Almost all decisions involve trade-offs; the most difficult are those that require understanding and prioritizing our values.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-internet-and-the-third-estate/">The Internet and the Third Estate</a> — Mark Zuckerberg suggested that social media is a “Fifth Estate”; in fact, social media is a means by which the Third Estate — commoners — can seize political power. Here history matters. <em>Related: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-liberty/">Tech and Liberty</a> and the policing of political speech.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-china-cultural-clash/">The China Cultural Clash</a> — The NBA controversy in China highlights a culture clash that both tech companies and the U.S. government need to take to heart. Plus, why Tiktok being Chinese is increasingly a problem. <em>Related: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/china-leverage-and-values/">China, Leverage, and Values</a>, about the trade war.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/privacy-fundamentalism/">Privacy Fundamentalism</a> — The current privacy debate is making things worse by not considering trade-offs, the inherent nature of digital, or the far bigger problems that come with digitizing the offline world.</li>
</ul>
<div align="center"><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/neither-and-new-lessons-from-uber-and-vision-fund/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Stratechery-2019-09-13-05.11.13-1024x768.png" alt="A drawing of The Synergy Between Tech Companies and Venture Capitalists" width="640" height="480" class="size-large wp-image-4387" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Stratechery-2019-09-13-05.11.13-1024x768.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Stratechery-2019-09-13-05.11.13-300x225.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Stratechery-2019-09-13-05.11.13-768x576.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Stratechery-2019-09-13-05.11.13-840x630.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></div>
<h4>Regulation and Antitrust</h4>
<p>While regulation was also a theme in 2018, this year I tried to get much more specific about how to think about the challenges presented by the Internet.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/where-warrens-wrong/">Where Warren’s Wrong</a> — Senator Warren’s proposal about how to regulate tech is wrong about history, the source of tech giant’s power, and the fundamental nature of technology itself. That doesn’t mean there aren’t real problems — and potential solutions — though.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-antitrust/">Tech and Antitrust</a> — A review of the potential antitrust cases against Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon suggests that only Google is vulnerable.</li>
<li>Three Frameworks:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/a-regulatory-framework-for-the-internet/">A Framework for Regulating Content on the Internet</a> — Regulators need to stop blindly regulating “the Internet” and instead understand that every part of the Internet stack is different, and only one part is suffering from market failure.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-moderation/">A Framework for Moderation</a> — The question of what should be moderated, and when, is an increasingly frequent one in tech. There is no bright line, but there are ways to get closer to an answer.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-regulating-competition-on-the-internet/">A Framework for Regulating Competition on the Internet</a> — Understanding the differences between platforms and Aggregators is critical when it comes to considering regulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div align="center"><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-moderation/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Paper.stratechery-Year-One-copy.310-1024x499.png" alt="A drawing of The Regulatory Framework for the Internet" width="640" height="312" class="size-large wp-image-4128" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Paper.stratechery-Year-One-copy.310-1024x499.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Paper.stratechery-Year-One-copy.310-300x146.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Paper.stratechery-Year-One-copy.310-768x374.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Paper.stratechery-Year-One-copy.310-1200x585.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></div>
<h4>The Big Tech Companies</h4>
<p>Tech&#8217;s continued centralization means that the biggest companies — Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook — receive the largest scrutiny.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/microsoft-slack-zoom-and-the-saas-opportunity/">Microsoft, Slack, Zoom, and the SaaS Opportunity</a> — The Zoom and Slack IPOs show what Microsoft is missing in its growth story: a way to acquire new customers.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/apples-audacity/">The First Post-iPhone Keynote</a> — This year’s WWDC presented an Apple that was finally ready to move past the iPhone. <em>Related: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/apples-errors/">Apple&#8217;s Errors</a> and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-iphone-and-apples-services-strategy/">The iPhone and Apple&#8217;s Services Strategy</a>.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/google-and-ambient-computing/">Google and Ambient Computing</a> — Google presented a vision of ambient computing that goes beyond the smartphone. The company is well-placed, but faces challenges both in the marketplace and in the mirror. <em>Related: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/beachheads-and-obstacles/">Beachheads and Obstacles</a> and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/google-fights-back/">Google Fights Back</a>.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/day-two-to-one-day/">Day Two to One Day</a> — Amazon.com was showing signs of being a Day Two company, including the alleged manipulation of search. There is reason, though, to be optimistic that the company has gotten back to Day One. Plus, where are the other big tech companies?</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/facebooks-privacy-cake/">Facebook’s Privacy Cake</a> — Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement of A Privacy-Focused Vision for Social Networking is not some dramatic pivot: it is a growth opportunity for Facebook and a challenge for regulators. <em>Related: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/facebook-libra-and-the-long-game/">Facebook, Libra, and the Long Game</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<div align="center"><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/google-and-ambient-computing/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/googleambient-1024x768.png" alt="A drawing of Google&#039;s Ambient Computing" width="640" height="480" class="size-large wp-image-4424" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/googleambient-1024x768.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/googleambient-300x225.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/googleambient-768x576.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/googleambient-840x630.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></div>
<h4>Media and Technology</h4>
<p>The most important development of the year in media was the launch of Disney+; I already linked to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/disney-and-the-future-of-tv/">Disney and the Future of TV</a>. Also:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/netflix-flexes/">Netflix Flexes</a> — Netflix is an Aggregator, with a value chain that lets it drive demand, raise prices, and dismiss competition.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/spotifys-podcast-aggregation-play/">Spotify’s Podcast Aggregation Play</a> — Spotify is making a major move into podcasts, where it appears to have clear designs to be the sort of Aggregator it cannot be when it comes to music.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-buzzfeed-lesson/">The BuzzFeed Lesson</a> — The lesson of BuzzFeed is that dominant Aggregators like Facebook have no incentive to act against their self interest and support suppliers. <em>Related: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-cost-of-apple-news/">The Cost of Apple News</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
<div align="center"><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/spotifys-podcast-aggregation-play/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/music-v-podcasts-1020x1024.png" alt="A drawing of The Music Value Chain Versus the Podcast Value Chain" width="640" height="643" class="size-large wp-image-4014" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/music-v-podcasts-1020x1024.png 1020w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/music-v-podcasts-150x150.png 150w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/music-v-podcasts-300x300.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/music-v-podcasts-768x771.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/music-v-podcasts-628x630.png 628w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/music-v-podcasts.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></div>
<h4>The Year in Daily Updates</h4>
<p>This year the Daily Update not only continued the trend towards single topics, but often became the place where new ideas and future Weekly Articles were first presented and fleshed out. I&#8217;m really proud of this evolution — this was a hard list to cull. Some of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-phenomenon-ninjas-2018-facebook-and-the-human-condition/">The Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Phenomenon, Ninja’s 2018, Facebook and the Human Condition</a> — The connection between Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ninja, and Facebook’s scandals</li>

That, by extension, is a result of the enterprise and consumer markets flip-flopping.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/disney-takes-full-control-of-hulu-disneys-organization-the-streaming-struggle/">Disney Takes Full Control of Hulu, Disney’s Organization, The Streaming Struggle</a> — Disney has acquired control of Hulu, and has structured itself to take full advantage.

<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/amd-launches-7nm-chips-sony-partners-with-microsoft-apple-and-aws/">AMD Launches 7nm Chips, Sony Partners with Microsoft, Apple and AWS</a> — AMD leapfrogs Intel thanks to modularity, Sony partners with Microsoft thanks to scale, and Apple balances both.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/libras-questionable-benefits-facebooks-hidden-costs-philosophical-objections/">Libra’s Questionable Benefits, Facebook’s Hidden Costs, Philosophical Objections</a> — While Facebook, Libra, and the Long Game was about analysis, this Daily Update is about opinion: I don’t think Libra is a good idea. <em>Related: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/libra-in-congress-global-community-revisited-messianic-versus-money-making/">Libra in Congress; Global Community, Revisited; Messianic Versus Money-Making</a>.</em></li>

Plus, why Facebook critics were asleep at the wheel. Then, Microsoft saving Apple has an analogy to IBM, and is a potential argument in favor of antitrust action. <em>Related: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/facebooks-ftc-settlement-assigning-blame-facebooks-earnings/">Facebook’s FTC Settlement, Assigning Blame, Facebook’s Earnings</a>.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/microsofts-earnings-teams-passes-slack-the-partner-advantage/">Microsoft’s Earnings, Teams Passes Slack, The Partner Advantage</a> — Microsoft continues to crush earnings with its integrated approach.

<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/apple-versus-project-zero-apples-poor-response-the-china-paradox/">Apple Versus Project Zero, Apple’s Poor Response, The China Paradox</a> — Apple took on Google’s Project Zero over the weekend, and didn’t come out looking particularly good, particularly since China is a huge paradox for Apple. <em>Related: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/apple-pulls-hong-kong-app-tim-cooks-memo-honesty-and-control/">Apple Pulls Hong Kong App, Tim Cook’s Memo, Honesty and Control</a>.</em></li>
