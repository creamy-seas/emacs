* Requirements
- Fira Code fonts
- Make
- Doom emacs

* Initial tangle
#+begin_src shell
make init
#+end_src

will tangle the =.org= files into =.elc= files
* Yasnippets
For faster yasnippets run

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(yas-recompile-all)
#+end_src

* Installing fonts
#+begin_src shell
brew tap caskroom/fonts
brew cask install font-fira-{sans,mono} font-dejavu-sans
#+end_src

and

#+begin_src shell
M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts
M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts
#+end_src

* Configuration
See the top sections of the following files to set personal customisation
- [[file:emailmode.org][Email configuration]]
- [[file:org-config.org][Orgmode configuration]]

Moreover, you can always go into the init.el file and comment out the modes you do not want to load

* Automatic formating
- Added with (format +onsave) in [[./init.el]]
- Need to install the relevant backend or it will silently fail

* Neotree with =C-c o p=


# Doom commands

Compile files into `.elc` - **remember, that you will need to recompile these files for them to have an effect** which is already handled by the tangle script

```
doom compile
```

Doom is an active project and many of its 300+ packages are in active development as well. It is wise to occasionally update:
```
doom upgrade
```
