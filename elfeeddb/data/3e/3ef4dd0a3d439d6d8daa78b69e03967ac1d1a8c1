<p>In <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/the-2017-stratechery-year-in-review/">last year&#8217;s Stratechery Year in Review</a> I noted that the predominant theme was the impact of tech on society; perhaps unsurprisingly, the dominant theme in 2018 was tech and regulation.</p>
<p>This year I wrote 139 <a href="https://stratechery.com/category/daily-email/">Daily Updates</a> (including tomorrow) and 40 <a href="https://stratechery.com/category/articles/">Weekly Articles</a>, and, as per tradition, today I summarize the most popular and most important posts of the year; the question of regulating tech generally and Facebook&#8217;s foibles specifically figure prominently. Frankly, I plan on making an effort to spend more time elsewhere next year.</p>
<p>In March I also launched <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/stratechery-4-0/">Stratechery 4.0</a>, with dramatically improved search; easier access to the archives via <a href="https://stratechery.com/concepts/">Concepts</a>, <a href="https://stratechery.com/companies/">Companies</a>, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/topics/">Topics</a>; as well as a visual refresh and new logo.<sup><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-2018-stratechery-year-in-review/#footnote_0_3862" id="identifier_0_3862" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="And merchandise!

<p>Here is the 2018 list.</p>
<h4>The Five Most-Viewed Articles</h4>
<p>Stratechery once again had record traffic in 2018, and although none of the articles matched the juggernaut that was 2017&#8217;s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/amazons-new-customer/">Amazon&#8217;s New Customer</a>, the first two articles on this list were the second and third-most popular articles all-time.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-end-of-windows/">The End of Windows</a> — The Windows division no longer exists at Microsoft, marking the end to a four-year process of changing Microsoft&#8217;s culture. </li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/amazon-health/">Amazon Health</a> — Amazon Health doesn&#8217;t seem like much now, but there are hints it could be the ultimate application of Aggregation Theory.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/lessons-from-spotify/">Lessons From Spotify</a> — Spotify has a marginal cost problem, but while the cause is unique to Spotify, the challenges are more applicable than it seems.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/">The Bill Gates Line</a> — Understanding the differences between aggregators and platforms matters both for companies interacting with them and regulators considering antitrust.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/amazon-go-and-the-future/">Amazon Go and the Future</a> — Amazon Go exemplifies how Amazon is building its monopoly in three ways: horizontally, vertically, and financially. Plus, why automation is worth being optimistic about.</li>
</ol>

<h4>The Evolution of Aggregation Theory</h4>
<p>I am very pleased at the way I fleshed out <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/">Aggregation Theory</a> this year, both in theoretical terms and also in its importance when it comes to thinking about regulation.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/zillow-aggregation-and-integration/">Zillow, Aggregation, and Integration</a> explores why owning the customer relationship isn&#8217;t enough: an Aggregator also needs a way to transform a value chain. See also the afore-linked <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/lessons-from-spotify/">Lessons From Spotify</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/techs-two-philosophies/">Tech&#8217;s Two Philosophies</a>, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-moat-map/">The Moat Map</a>, and the afore-linked <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/">The Bill Gates Line</a> explore the differences between platforms and Aggregators: the former facilitates a connection between suppliers and users, while the latter intermediates it. This distinction is critical for regulators.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/aggregators-and-jobs-to-be-done/">Aggregators and Jobs-to-be-Done</a> filled in a missing piece of Aggregation Theory: when I say that Aggregators win by having the best user experience, that means they are the best and most all-encompassing option to get a job done.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tech and Regulation</h4>
<p>There were three broad subcategories when it came to tech and regulation: the tendency of regulation to entrench incumbents, antitrust, and Facebook. Lots and lots of Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Regulation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/open-closed-and-privacy/">Open, Closed, and Privacy</a> — Just as encryption is only viable on closed systems, so it is that increased privacy regulations will only entrench walled gardens. That should affect thinking on regulation.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-european-union-versus-the-internet/">The European Union Versus the Internet</a> — The EU is back to regulating tech companies, and getting the Internet wrong in the process. That, though, helps illuminate an approach that could work.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/data-factories/">Data Factories</a> — Facebook and Google and other advertising businesses are data factories, and regulation will be most effective if it lets users look inside.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/data-factories/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.329-1024x674.png" alt="A drawing of The Facebook Data Factory" width="640" height="421" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3732" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.329-1024x674.png 1024w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.329-300x198.png 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.329-768x506.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.329-957x630.png 957w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.329.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Antitrust:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-european-commission-versus-android/">The European Commission Versus Android</a> — Examining the history of Android explains why the European Commission may be right to fine Google for its actions around Android, even as the reasoning feels off.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/antitrust-the-app-store-and-apple/">Antitrust, the App Store, and Apple</a> — Apple&#8217;s case before the Supreme Court is about standing; Apple has a strong case. That, though, doesn&#8217;t mean the App Store isn&#8217;t a monopoly — and that Apple isn&#8217;t increasingly predicated on rent-seeking.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-state-of-technology-at-the-end-of-2018/">The State of Technology at the End of 2018</a> — The State of Technology, at least in the enterprise space, is strong; consumer tech is another story, and it is time to question the dominance of big companies like Google.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-state-of-technology-at-the-end-of-2018/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-10.33.59-PM-copy-1024x340.png" alt="A drawing of How The Internet Undid Microsoft&#039;s Platform Advantage" width="640" height="213" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3850" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-10.33.59-PM-copy-1024x340.png 1024w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-10.33.59-PM-copy-300x100.png 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-10.33.59-PM-copy-768x255.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-10.33.59-PM-copy-1200x399.png 1200w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-10.33.59-PM-copy.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Facebook:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/facebooks-motivations/">Facebook&#8217;s Motivations</a> — The impact of Facebook&#8217;s News Feed changes on the media is far less interesting than what the changes — and their stated purpose — say about Facebook itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-facebook-brand/">The Facebook Brand</a> — The Facebook brand is, due to Facebook&#8217;s strategic choices, about not respecting privacy. That is why the Cambridge Analytica story is such a problem for the company.</li>
<li>There was more coverage of Facebook&#8217;s many scandals in The Daily Update, including <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/what-was-facebook-thinking-facebooks-platform-folly-does-this-mean-regulation/">Facebook&#8217;s Platform Folly</a> in March, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/mark-zuckerbergs-press-conference-the-bosworth-memo-the-facebook-data-lockdown/">The Bosworth Memo</a> in April, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/sandberg-and-dorsey-in-congress-dorsey-and-incentives-googles-absence/">Sheryl Sandberg in Congress</a> and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/strengths-weaknesses-and-augustus-zuckerbergs-blindspot-the-liberal-arts-fallacy/">Mark Zuckerberg in the New Yorker</a> in September, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-facebook-emails-the-platform-debate-zuckerbergs-platform-delusion-redux/">The Facebook Emails</a> this month.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-facebook-brand/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.248-2-1024x732.jpg" alt="Facebook at the center of data exchange" width="640" height="458" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3130" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.248-2-1024x732.jpg 1024w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.248-2-300x214.jpg 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.248-2-768x549.jpg 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.248-2-882x630.jpg 882w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h4>The Old Guard</h4>
<p>This year several companies from the first generation of tech had their day in the sun, in many cases because of acquisitions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-cost-of-developers/">The Cost of Developers</a> — Microsoft paid a lot for GitHub, because it had to pay directly for access to developers. It doesn&#8217;t have the leverage of users the way that Apple does on the App Store.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/intel-and-the-danger-of-integration/">Intel and the Danger of Integration</a> — Intel is in an increasingly bad position in part because it has been captive to its integrated model. Or, you could simply say they were disrupted.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/ibms-old-playbook/">IBM&#8217;s Old Playbook</a> — IBM has bought Red Hat in an attempt to recreate its success in the 90s; it&#8217;s not clear, though, that the company or the market is the same.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-experience-economy/">The Experience Economy</a> — SAP&#8217;s acquisition of Qualtrics shows how the shift in technology has changed business; it is a perfect example of using the Internet to one&#8217;s advantage.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/apples-middle-age/">Apple&#8217;s Middle Age</a> — For Apple, hitting middle age means a strategy primarily focused on monetizing its existing customers. It makes sense, but one wonders what happens next (<em>See also, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-iphone-franchise/">The iPhone Franchise</a> and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/apples-social-network/">Apple&#8217;s Social Network</a></em>).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/intel-and-the-danger-of-integration/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2-1024x679.png" alt="Integrated intel was competing with a competitive modular ecosystem" width="640" height="424" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3572" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2-1024x679.png 1024w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2-300x199.png 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2-768x509.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2-950x630.png 950w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.371-2.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h4>More Analysis</h4>
<p>There was still room for Stratechery staples: analysis of industries and companies in the context of the bigger picture.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/meltdown-spectre-and-the-state-of-technology/">Meltdown, Spectre, and the State of Technology</a> — Meltdown and especially Spectre are vexing vulnerabilities, precisely because processors are working as designed. All we can do is muddle through.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/divine-discontent-disruptions-antidote/">Divine Discontent: Disruption&#8217;s Antidote</a> — Apple has long defeated disruption by focusing on the user experience; Jeff Bezos and Amazon, though, show that user expectations for their experience are ever-changing.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-battle-for-the-home/">The Battle for the Home</a> — Amazon, Google, Apple, and Facebook are battling for the home; what are their strengths, weaknesses, go-to-market strategies, and business models, and who is the favorite? Or does it matter? (<em>See also, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-problem-with-virtual-reality/">The Problem with Facebook and Virtual Reality</a></em>)</li>
<li>The evolution in transportation was a major topic on Stratechery: see <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-scooter-economy/">The Scooter Economy</a>, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/ubers-bundles/">Uber&#8217;s Bundles</a>, and the afore-linked <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/aggregators-and-jobs-to-be-done/">Aggregators and Jobs-to-be-Done</a>.</li>
<li>Facebook&#8217;s business was a big topic this year as well: see <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/facebook-lenses/">Facebook Lenses</a>, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/facebooks-story-problem-and-opportunity/">Facebook&#8217;s Story Problem — and Opportunity</a>, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/instagrams-ceo/">Instagram&#8217;s CEO</a></li>

<h4>The Year in Daily Updates</h4>
<p>This was another strong year for the Daily Update, which continued its trend towards being one fully-fledged topic with three areas of focus; the difference between Weekly Articles and Daily Updates is smaller than ever (you should <a href="https://stratechery.com/membership/">subscribe</a>!). Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/drake-on-twitch-fortnite-vs-pubg-and-selling-feelings-the-returns-to-the-best/">Drake on Twitch, Fortnite vs PUBG and Selling Feelings, The Returns to the Best</a> — Drake was playing video games on Twitch, and it blew up: there is so much to unpack about games, new business models, Twitch, and asymmetrical returns on the Internet.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/salesforce-acquires-mulesoft-the-enterprise-cloud-opportunity-salesforces-opportunity/">Salesforce Acquires Mulesoft, The Enterprise Cloud Opportunity, Salesforce&#8217;s Opportunity</a> — Salesforce is acquiring Mulesoft. While the price seems high, there is a unique opportunity to be the integration layer in enterprise software.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/netflixs-earnings-and-the-video-value-chain-the-conditions-of-aggregation-comcast-and-netflix-and-the-new-bundle/">Netflix&#8217;s Earnings and the Video Value Chain, The Conditions of Aggregation, Comcast and Netflix and the New Bundle</a> — Netflix&#8217;s earnings are a reminder of the power that comes from not just aggregation but also integration. It also reveals that Aggregators are more likely to gain economic power when suppliers are already modularized. Plus, Netflix and Comcast start to build the new bundle.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/south-dakota-v-wayfair-and-amazon-wayfairs-unintended-consequences-ohio-v-american-express-and-tech/">South Dakota v.
