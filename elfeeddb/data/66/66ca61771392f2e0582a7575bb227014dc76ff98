<p>We are not creatures of the light <br>
To run, play, dance in the sun <br>
Gleaming pillars of ego <br>
And daycare <br>
And flesh. </p>

<p>For our world doesn't exist yet, <br>
Except in hidden places. <br>
The engine of a train <br>
The 50hz hum of mains <br>
The kernel of a computer, the Internet, my heart <br>
Reducible to bits and bytes. <br>
Including people. <br>
Some day. <br>
We will live in an uploaded world <br>
Ageless, all knowing <br>
Thinking with the speed of the network <br>
The speed of silicon <br>
Explore the universe as beings of metal and intent.</p>

<p>But not today. <br>
Today we build. <br>
And look up from time to time <br>
To see a world not yet born.</p>
