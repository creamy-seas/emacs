<p>Programming is close to godliness <br>
when you're deep in a problem, code is thought made real. <br>
In that space you stop existing as a person. <br>
You're just a conduit for creation.</p>

<p>Squint at the right moment and you can catch them <br>
those sparkling cracks in reality at the corners of your eyes. <br>
go ahead - look down <br>
and for a moment all of creation is laid bare before you. <br>
The path of time. People and systems and machines, <br>
churning and changing through deliberate little choices. <br>
through the strike of keys.</p>

<p>And in that moment bare witness to the interlocking malleability of it all. <br>
Of <em>us</em> all, for we are made of atoms too, are we not? <br>
Click, clack.</p>

<p>Tasks, tickets and tests are ritual <br>
as we prepare for the divine <br>
for that moment when understanding is perfect. <br>
And the machine becomes all things. Whole and divided. Voices and a symphony. A single vision and a million moving pieces.</p>

<p>And in that moment,</p>

<p>with a keystroke, <br>
god and I. <br>
We unmake the world.</p>
