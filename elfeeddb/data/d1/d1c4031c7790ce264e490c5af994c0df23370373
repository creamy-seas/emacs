<p>I'm so sick of MacOS's default background images. They're <em>pretty</em>, I've just seen them all so many times now.</p>

<p><em>Uuuuuggghhh</em></p>

<p>So in the spirit of Sam's <a href="https://samgentle.com/posts/2016-05-09-prototype-wrapup-21">daily prototypes</a> I decided to do something about it. Enter <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> - a service / platform / thing with a huge database of completely free, beautiful photos.</p>

<p>Oh, and it has <a href="https://source.unsplash.com/">an API</a>. <a href="https://source.unsplash.com/category/nature/featured">Here's a random nature photo</a>!</p>

<p>MacOS supports pulling desktop wallpapers from a directory. So I wrote <a href="https://github.com/josephg/unsplash">a script</a> that pulls down a random featured image in each category I like. Most of the logic is for figuring out a good (stable) filename and discarding already-downloaded images.</p>

<p>Finally I added a <a href="https://github.com/josephg/unsplash/blob/master/unsplash.plist">launchctl plist</a> which runs the script every 6 hours. Eventually my directory will be huge, but I can tweak the script manually when that happens.</p>

<p>So now my secondary display shows a beautiful space lady in space. Being surprised is <em>delightful</em>.</p>

<p>If you want the same great experience, right now you need to:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/josephg/unsplash.git  
cd unsplash  
npm install -g .  
cp unsplash.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/  
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/unsplash.plist  
</code></pre>

<p>By default it'll download images at 2560x1440 in the 'buildings', 'food', 'nature', 'objects' and 'people' categories. They get saved to <code>~/unsplash</code> in your home directory. Tweak the script directly if you like.</p>

<p>Run <code>unsplash-get</code> a few times to kick it off and make sure its working.</p>

<p>I could automate all of that, but I'm not going to. I could have used the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/unsplash">official nodejs unsplash library</a>, but I didn't and I don't care because its working for me now.</p>

<p>Have fuuuun!</p>
