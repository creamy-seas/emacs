# emacs
boomer setup

I've been creating this fully functional baby from scratch. One of the first things I did, was change the awful white background and pipe in some nice inconsolata fonts.
```init.el must be copied into the ~/.emacs.d directory```
From then one, there have been a few fields of imporevement
 - Gettings emacs to do what is should be doing
 - Latex with Skim (because muh mac)
 - Org mode customisation
