I've been creating this fully functional baby from scratch. The most useful commands are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Meta</kbd>.



## Essential autism ##
- ```init.el``` must be copied into the ```~/.emacs.d``` directory.
- Install `inconsolata` fonts by downloading the `.ttf` file
- Setup the python virtual environment:
  `mkvirtualenv NAME` -> run `install_python.sh` script from [jannies hub](https://github.com/creamy-seas/jannies)

## Cool features ##
- One of the first things I did, was change the awful white background and pipe in some nice inconsolata fonts.
- Very seamless <kbd>python</kbd> development using elpy
- Redpilled and based <kbd>LaTeX</kbd> environment, with all the highlighting you would ever need
- Unreal <kbd>orgmode</kbd> customization

Work in progess.
